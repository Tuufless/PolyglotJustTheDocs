# PolyglotJustTheDocs

[GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

If you don't already have a local copy of the repository, navigate to the 
location where you want to store the source files, replacing `PARENT-FOLDER`
with the folder you want to contain the folder for the repository.
```
cd PARENT-FOLDER
```
Note: This is **not** the repository's folder- that will go _inside_ this
folder.

Navigate to this folder, and clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Tuufless/PolyglotJustTheDocs.git
```

This will create the following folders:

```
PARENT-FOLDER
  `-- PolyglotJustTheDocs
      `-- .git
```
You now have a local copy of an empty repo.
